# ⚡ Energy Consumption Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

**Energy Consumption Analysis** is a data analysis project focused on transforming raw energy usage data into an interactive and insightful dashboard.

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end analytics workflow:

- Data cleaning & transformation using **Power Query**
- Data normalization into a structured **data model**
- Importing data into **PowerPivot**
- Creating Pivot Tables & Charts
- Building an interactive Excel Dashboard

The final output is a fully interactive dashboard that enables dynamic exploration of energy consumption trends.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

- Removed null and duplicate values  
- Standardized column names  
- Converted data types  
- Created calculated columns  
- Performed data reshaping where necessary  

### 2️⃣ Data Modeling

- Normalized raw data into relational tables  
- Created relationships between fact and dimension tables  
- Applied star-schema modeling principles  

### 3️⃣ PowerPivot Integration

- Imported cleaned data model into PowerPivot  
- Created calculated measures (e.g., Total Consumption, Average Usage, Growth Rate)  
- Built KPI metrics using DAX formulas  

### 4️⃣ Analysis & Visualization

- Built Pivot Tables for:
  - Consumption by region
  - Monthly & yearly trends
  - Category-wise analysis
- Created dynamic charts linked to slicers  
- Designed an interactive dashboard layout

## 📈 Example Insights (Sample Findings)

> ⚠️ These are placeholder insights for demonstration purposes.

- Energy consumption shows a steady upward trend over the last 5 years.
- Residential consumption accounts for the highest percentage of total usage.
- Peak consumption occurs during summer months.
- Certain regions demonstrate significantly higher growth rates compared to others.
- Energy efficiency improvements reduced average per-unit consumption in recent years.
